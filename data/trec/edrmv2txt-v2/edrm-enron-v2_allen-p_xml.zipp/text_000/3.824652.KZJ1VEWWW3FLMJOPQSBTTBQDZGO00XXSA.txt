Bob,

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti 
was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.  
 Please call to discuss cash award.

Phillip
